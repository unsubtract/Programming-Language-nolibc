# Programming-Language-nolibc

---

[github.com/unsubtract/Programming-Language](https://github.com/unsubtract/Programming-Language)
reimplemented without linking to the C standard library, for educational purposes.

Based largely on the article [mirrored here](https://gist.github.com/tcoppex/443d1dd45f873d96260195d6431b0989).
Most of the CFLAGS in the Makefile are taken from [nolibc-httpd](https://github.com/Francesco149/nolibc-httpd).

Currrently only x86_64 Linux, and there are also most likely severe technical
flaws with the program as of now.
